# 🎵 Neon-Melody: The Ultimate Song Guessing Game

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x300/0a0010/a45ee5?text=Neon+Melody+Game)

> A logic-based web game where players deduce a hidden song by asking the system strategic questions. Featuring a "Midnight & Lilac" aesthetic, smart exclusion logic, and Spotify integration.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Smart Logic Engine
The game utilizes a tiered questioning system that adapts as your score (questions left) decreases:
1.  **Vague Phase (20-15 turns):** Broad filters (Gender, Title length).
2.  **Balancing Phase (14-9 turns):** Logic bridges (Genre style, Group size, Era) with **Exclusion Logic** (e.g., if "Male" is confirmed, "Female" questions are banned).
3.  **Killer Phase (8-4 turns):** Specific identifiers (Nationality, Agency, Sample usage).
4.  **Signature Phase (3-0 turns):** Dead giveaways (Lyric snippets, Album covers, Audio previews).

### 🎨 Immersive Aesthetic
* **Midnight & Lilac Theme:** A deep black and purple color palette.
* **Atmospheric Effects:** Smooth background animations, spotlight cursor tracking, and a gentle snowfall effect for the holidays.
* **Glassmorphism:** Modern UI elements with frosted glass effects and neon glows.
* **Ultra-Smooth Animations:** Fluid transitions using cubic-bezier curves.

### 🎧 Spotify Integration
* **Real-time Data:** Fetches Album Art and Track IDs dynamically.
* **Audio Player:** Unlocks an embedded Spotify player upon winning or losing.

## ⚙️ Configuration (Spotify API)

This project uses the Spotify Web API. To ensure the game works correctly, you should generate your own API credentials.

1.  Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/).
2.  Create a new app.
3.  Copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
4.  Open `script.js` and locate the configuration section at the top:

```javascript
// ==========================================
// 0. SPOTIFY CONFIGURATION
// ==========================================
const clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE";
const clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE";
